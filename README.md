# Building a Blockchain

Makers Academy week 9 project. In one week we learnt what a Blockchain is and built a working prototype.

Please find the demonstration on the project as well as a presentation on what is a blockchain here: [Video Demo & What is a Blockchain Presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5-nSosdGk)

## Approach

We first needed understand what a Blockchain was. This involved research and group sessions on whiteboards, projectors and verbal discussions until each member of the team understood the entire concept.

We also approached the topic by experimenting with both Javascript and Python. After having basic prototypes in Javascript and Python, we started again from scratch in Ruby to cement our knowledge.
