# Building a Blockchain

Makers Academy week 9 project. In one week we learnt what a Blockchain is and built a working prototype.

Please find a demonstration of the project as well as a presentation on what is a blockchain here: [Video Demo & What is a Blockchain Presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5-nSosdGk)

This was a group of four people, please find us here:

## Approach

We first needed to understand what a Blockchain was. This involved research and group sessions on whiteboards, projectors and verbal discussions with each other until each member of the team understood the entire concept.

We also approached the topic by experimenting with both Javascript and Python. After having basic prototypes in Javascript and Python, we started again from scratch in Ruby to cement our knowledge.

## Tech Stack

The final Blockchain was developed in Ruby. The interface was developed with erb, Bootstrap and JQuery. The server with Sinatra.

## How it works

To understand in more depth I would urge you to view the [Video Demo & What is a Blockchain Presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5-nSosdGk)

## How to install

1. Clone this repo
2. in terminal run `git clone https://github.com/RobertClayton/building_a_blockchain.git`
3. in terminal run `cd building_a_blockchain`
4. in terminal run `gem install bundle`
5. in terminal run `bundle`
6. in terminal run `bundle exec rackup`
7. in a browser go to http://localhost:9292/
8. The program is now running! - you can add a **New Transaction** via the tap at the top and mine pending transactions with the **Mine** button. The Blockchain is viewable on the **Home** tab on the right. The Proof-of-Work is viewable on the Home tab on the left after a transaction has been mined.
